### List

A *SassScript list* (usually referred to as just a *list*) is an ordered
sequence of SassScript values. A list may or may not be *bracketed*, and a list
has a *separator* which is one of "space", "comma", "slash", or "undecided".
Only lists with zero or one elements may have an "undecided" separator.
